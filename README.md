# Introduction

We all thought of having an iPhone taken apart and framed for its beauty.

Our initial concept was preserving the internal beauty of our everyday electronic devices inside of a beautiful frame. 

Now, it's possible.


The iRetro Store is a concept website that sells framed, taken apart iPhones. 

The website is built using a combination of Django (a Python web framework) and React-Typescript (a JavaScript library for building user interfaces), and uses several other technologies, including Django Rest Framework API, React-Redux, PostgreSQL, and JWT. 

The website features a login/register system, an active cart, PayPal checkout API, and an admin panel using Django Administration. The source code for the website is available on GitHub and can be installed on a local machine or Docker Desktop by following the step-by-step tutorial in the README.md file. 
# Features
- Login + Register (including registration email)
- Active Cart + PayPal Sandbox API
- Admin Panel using Django Administration
- User Profile + Updating Information
# Browser Support
